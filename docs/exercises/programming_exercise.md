## 第一周题目 —— Palindromes

### Description

A regular palindrome is a string of numbers or letters that is the same forward as backward. For example, the string "ABCDEDCBA" is a palindrome because it is the same when the string is read from left to right as when the string is read from right to left.  

A mirrored string is a string for which when each of the elements of the string is changed to its reverse (if it has a reverse) and the string is read backwards the result is the same as the original string. For example, the string "3AIAE" is a mirrored string because "A" and "I" are their own reverses, and "3" and "E" are each others' reverses.  

A mirrored palindrome is a string that meets the criteria of a regular palindrome and the criteria of a mirrored string. The string "ATOYOTA" is a mirrored palindrome because if the string is read backwards, the string is the same as the original and because if each of the characters is replaced by its reverse and the result is read backwards, the result is the same as the original string.  

Of course,"A","T", "O", and "Y" are all their own reverses.  

A list of all valid characters and their reverses is as follows.  


|Character|Reverse|Character|Reverse|Character|Reverse|  
|----|----|----|----|----|----| 
|A	|A	|M	|M	|Y	|Y|  
|B	| 	|N	| 	|Z	|5|  
|C	| 	|O	|O	|1	|1|  
|D	| 	|P	| 	|2	|S|  
|E	|3	|Q	| 	|3	|E|  
|F	| 	|R	| 	|4	| |  
|G	| 	|S	|2	|5	|Z|  
|H	|H	|T	|T	|6	| |  
|I	|I	|U	|U	|7	| |  
|J	|L	|V	|V	|8	|8|  
|K	| 	|W	|W	|9	| |  
|L	|J	|X	|X	| 	| |  

Note that 0 (zero) and O (the letter) are considered the same character and therefore ONLY the letter "0" is a valid character.  

### Input
Input consists of strings (one per line) each of which will consist of one to twenty valid characters. There will be no invalid characters in any of the strings. Your program should read to the end of file.  

### Output
For each input string, you should print the string starting in column 1 immediately followed by exactly one of the following strings.  

| STRING | CRITERIA |  
|------|------|  
| " -- is not a palindrome." | if the string is not a palindrome and is not a mirrored string |  
| " -- is a regular palindrome." | if the string is a palindrome and is not a mirrored string |  
| " -- is a mirrored string." | if the string is not a palindrome and is a mirrored string |  
| " -- is a mirrored palindrome." | if the string is a palindrome and is a mirrored string |  

Note that the output line is to include the -'s and spacing exactly as shown in the table above and demonstrated in the Sample Output below.  

In addition, after each output line, you must print an empty line.  

### Sample Input
```
NOTAPALINDROME 
ISAPALINILAPASI 
2A3MEAS 
ATOYOTA

```

### Sample Output
```
NOTAPALINDROME -- is not a palindrome.
 
ISAPALINILAPASI -- is a regular palindrome.
 
2A3MEAS -- is a mirrored string.
 
ATOYOTA -- is a mirrored palindrome.

```


## 第二周题目 —— IP Networks

### Description

Alex is administrator of IP networks. His clients have a bunch of individual IP addresses and he decided to group all those IP addresses into the smallest possible IP network.  

Each IP address is a 4-byte number that is written byte-by-byte in a decimal dot-separated notation "byte0.byte1.byte2.byte3" (quotes are added for clarity). Each byte is written as a decimal number from 0 to 255 (inclusive) without extra leading zeroes.  

IP network is described by two 4-byte numbers - network address and network mask. Both network address and network mask are written in the same notation as IP addresses.  

In order to understand the meaning of network address and network mask you have to consider their binary representation. Binary representation of IP address, network address, and network mask consists of 32 bits: 8 bits for byte0 (most significant to least significant), followed by 8 bits for byte1, followed by 8 bits for byte2, and followed by 8 bits for byte3.  

IP network contains a range of 2n IP addresses where 0<=n<=32 . Network mask always has 32 - n first bits set to one, and n last bits set to zero in its binary representation. Network address has arbitrary 32 - n first bits, and n last bits set to zero in its binary representation. IP network contains all IP addresses whose 32 - n first bits are equal to 32 - n first bits of network address with arbitrary n last bits. We say that one IP network is smaller than the other IP network if it contains fewer IP addresses.  

For example, IP network with network address 194.85.160.176 and network mask 255.255.255.248 contains 8 IP addresses from 194.85.160.176 to 194.85.160.183 (inclusive).  

### Input

The input file will contain several test cases, each of them as described below.  

The first line of the input file contains a single integer number m (1<=m<=1000) . The following m lines contain IP addresses, one address on a line. Each IP address may appear more than once in the input file.  

### Output

For each test case, write to the output file two lines that describe the smallest possible IP network that contains all IP addresses from the input file. Write network address on the first line and network mask on the second line.  

### Sample Input
```
3 
194.85.160.177 
194.85.160.183 
194.85.160.178

```

### Sample Output
```
194.85.160.176 
255.255.255.248

```
