# SIFT --Scale-invariant feature transform
Abstract : a project using SIFT algorithm to match feature points in two pictures

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
softeware needed
```
ubuntu 16.04

```
## Running the tests
enter the floder '1_SIFT',using cmd:
```
cmake .
make 
./bin/SIFT
```

the input images are int the floder
```
./data
```

### Samples output
output samples include to picture,one is detect the keypoint and the other is matching keypoint for the two similar images 
```
./output
```
