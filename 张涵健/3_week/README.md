 - Abstract: Program for basic digit recognization. Built on opencv and c++. All samples are in "data" dir. "bin" has a.out for the program, which you should input the img with path like "../data/sim_samples/sim_sample1.jpg" when you are in "bin".  All the rsult I have done is in the "result_p" folder. The compile method is follows:
1. cd build
2. cmake ..
3. make
